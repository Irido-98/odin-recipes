    <p>Need a simple comfort-food lunch? This lasagna-in-a-bowl wants to be your friend. Great when cooking for one.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul><strong>
        <li>2 lasagna noodles</li>
        <li>1.5 cups water</li>
        <li>0.25 cup marinara sauce</li>
        <li>0.25 cup chopped cherry tomatoes</li>
        <li>0.5 tablespoon chopped fresh basil</li>
        <li>0.5 cip shredded low fat mozzarella cheese</li>
    </strong></ul>

    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <h4>Step 1</h4>
    <p>Break each lasagna noodle into 6 rectangular pieces. Place noodles in a 4-cup microwave-safe bowl. Add water, making sure noodles are covered and water level is about halfway up the bowl. Place the bowl on a microwave-safe plate.</p>

    <h4>Step 2</h4>
    <p>Cook in the microwave on high for 2 minutes. Stir pasta quickly to keep it from clumping. Cook in 2-minute increments, stirring between, and emptrying any water that has boiled over onto the plate. Repeat until lasagna is tender yet firm to the bite, about 6 minutes total. Drain noodles, reserving 1 tablespoon of the cooking liquid. Return noodles and reserved liquid to the bowl.</p>

    <h4>Step 3</h4>
    <p>Stir marinara sauce and chopped tomatoes into the bowl, mixing until incorporated. Sprinkle on basil, and then mozzarella cheese. Cover surface of the bowl with a paper towel to prevent splatter and microwave until cheese is completely melted and tomato sauce is warmed, 1 to 1 1/2 minutes. Serve immediately.</p>
